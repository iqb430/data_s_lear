# ðŸŒ± Data Science Learning Journey  
**Hi! I'm Iqbal**  
*Beginner in Data Science | Passionate About Learning*

Welcome to my learning repository! This is where I document my progress as I learn data science from scratch. I use GitHub to store practice code, notes, and small projects as part of my 100-day journey into data science.
